# Clinical-Data-Analyses
Explored 20 million rows of hospital clinical data across multiple years, focusing on trends influenced by diverse factors.

## Project Overview
In this project, I generated 20 million synthetic records using dynamic SQL in SQL Server to simulate large-scale healthcare clinical data. I used loops, conditional logic, and dynamic query construction to populate different types of fields â€” including numeric values (like counts), non-numeric text fields (like names and categories), and realistic random date ranges.

This process helped me learn how to automate large dataset creation and manage data type-specific logic in SQL dynamically. Once the data was ready, I connected SQL Server to Power BI, where I built a report analyzing hospital-wise trends in clinical metrics like:

1. Number of admissions

2. Readmissions

3. Infections

4. Deaths

Year-wise comparisons across hospitals

The project helped me to learn how to write dynamic SQL, handling large volumes of data, and visualizing insights through Power BI
